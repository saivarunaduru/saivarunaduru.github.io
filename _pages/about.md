I am a PhD student in the Lopatkin Lab, at the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Rochester, programming microbial communities through plasmid conjugation. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Digital Applications and Technology (DAT) team at GE Water/SUEZ WTS, where I developed advanced analytics for modeling industrial water treatment units. Before that, I worked as a Battery Control Engineer at BattGenie Inc. and M.A.P.L.E lab, implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithms for optimal charging of lithium-ion batteries. 

I completed my Masters' degree from University of Washington (UW), Seattle, where I was a graduate trainee of NSF funded UW Clean Energy Institute (CEI)'s DIRECT (Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technologies) program. I received my Bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering from Andhra University(AU), Visakhapatnam, India.
